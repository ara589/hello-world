### About me:

I am a Ph.D. student in the Earth Science and Environmental Sustainability program at NAU. I work in the FEWSION Lab under Dr. Ben Ruddell, reivsing a curriculum that fosters participatory citizen science around food, energy, and water supply chains. I moved to Flagstaff after living in the Verde Valley for $20$ years.
